This is a project built during the Grace Hopper/Fullstack Academy Stackathon.


I utilized the Victory JavaScript library to help visualize whether they should/should not do something based on the user's input. Also testing out the Web Speech API to get the user's input via speech!

React and React Redux are used to render the front-end components. Sequelize and Express are used to handle the backend requests for data.
